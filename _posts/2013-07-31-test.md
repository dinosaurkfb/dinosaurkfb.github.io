This article discusses multi-touch gestures on Android from a beginners perspective. It demonstrates an approach that allows for "standard" gestures such as slide-to-move and pinch-to-zoom but also endevours to go beyond those and attempt turn-to-rotate.

Focus of the article will be the math required and how to capture the input required to compute the gestures, the example application will of course provide a way of capturing and rendering the result of gestures performed. 
It will also discuss why the turn-to-rotate doesn't work that well, at least not on all devices. 
The article does not aim to be a complete guide to gestures on Android, but rather a way in to understanding touch events and how they can be used to manipulate an image.


Some experience working with Eclipse and the Android SDK is assumed, so I won't explain how to get that all set up (there are much better explanations to that than I could ever provide).
